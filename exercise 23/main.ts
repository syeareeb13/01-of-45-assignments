//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

let five = 5;
let ten = 10;
// test 1
console.log("Test:1 five is equal to 5");
console.log( five ==5);
// test 2
console.log("Test:2 ten is equal to 10");
console.log( ten ==10);
//test 3
console.log("Test: 3 five is not equal to 10");
console.log( five !== 10);
// test 4
console.log("Test:4 ten is greater than 5");
console.log( ten>5);
//test 5
console.log("Test:5 five is less than 10");
console.log( five < 10);
// test 6
console.log("Test:6 ten is less than 5");
console.log( ten <5);
//test 7
console.log("Test:7 five is equal to 10");
console.log( five == 10);
//test 8
console.log("Test:8 ten is not equal to 10");
console.log(10!==10);
//test 9
console.log("Test:9 five is greater than 10");
console.log( 5> 10);
// test 10
console.log("Test:10 five is not equal to 5");
console.log( 5!==5);
