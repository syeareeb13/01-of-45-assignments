// Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of arguments each time.


function makeSandwich(...items:string[]){
    console.log("\nmaking the sandwish with the following items:\n")
    items.forEach(singleItem =>
        console.log(singleItem)
    )
    console.log("\nNow enjoy sandwich");
}
makeSandwich("Bread", "Butter")
makeSandwich("Chicken", "Cheese","Egg")
makeSandwich("Bread", "Butter", "Tomato", "Chicken", "Cheese", "Egg", "Mayo" )
