// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as â€œI would like to own a Honda motorcycle.

let transportation :string[] = ["Hilux", "Prado" , "Civic", "Vitz"]
transportation.map((items) => console.log(`i would like to owm a ${items}.`))
